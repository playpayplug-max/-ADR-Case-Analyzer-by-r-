## About The Project

This project was built to solve a key challenge for pharmacovigilance professionals: the overwhelming and chaotic nature of raw, unstructured case narratives. The ADR Case Analyzer is a client-side tool that transforms this chaos into clear, structured, and actionable insights in seconds.

This repository contains two main parts:
1.  **`index.html`**: A "scrollytelling" marketing website designed to explain the problem and showcase the solution using modern animations.
2.  **`app.html`**: The functional, single-page application where users can analyze their case data securely.

## Key Features

*   üîí **Completely Offline:** All processing happens in the browser. Sensitive case data never leaves the user's device, ensuring 100% privacy and security.
*   üåê **Cross-Platform Compatible:** No installation required. Works seamlessly on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
*   üìä **Smart Analysis & Dashboard:** Instantly extracts and categorizes Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) and provides a clear summary for faster decision-making.
*   üöÄ **Modern Animated Interface:** The marketing page uses GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) and ScrollTrigger to create a smooth, professional, and engaging user experience.

## Tech Stack

*   HTML5
*   CSS3
*   Vanilla JavaScript
*   **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** for animations
*   **ScrollTrigger** for scroll-based animations
